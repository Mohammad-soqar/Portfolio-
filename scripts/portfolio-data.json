The glove integrates motion and biomedical sensors to track hand movement, stiffness, and condition progression related to rheumatoid arthritis. Data is transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy to a Flutter mobile application, where patients can view their condition in real time.\nA vibration-based relief system embedded inside the glove activates during detected flare-ups to help reduce discomfort.\nOn the clinical side, a dedicated web platform allows doctors to review patient history, monitor trends, manage appointments, and receive AI-generated medical reports based on collected sensor data.\nThe project was validated nationally after ranking 8th place at Technofest, competing against over 13,000 projects in the Health Technologies category.",

The project includes not only a research-grade RAG pipeline, but also a fully custom Next.js web application, built from scratch to support real legal workflows.\n\nThe platform enables lawyers and researchers to interact with AI through a structured dashboard: managing chats, uploading legal documents, reviewing citations, and navigating sources with full transparency. Every UI decision was guided by legal usability principlesÔÇöclarity, traceability, and trust.\n\nSnowLex treats law as structured knowledge, not just text. The system enforces citation grounding at every step, ensuring that AI responses are not only fast, but legally defensible.",
